## 📌 Purpose of This Repository  

This repository helps me to:

- Practice coding problems consistently  
- Strengthen DSA concepts  
- Improve logical thinking  
- Track my progress  
- Prepare for technical interviews  

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered  

Problems belong to different DSA topics such as:

- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked Lists

## 🚀 Learning Approach  

For each problem, I follow this approach:

1. Understand the problem statement  
2. Think of a brute-force solution  
3. Optimize using DSA concepts  
4. Write clean and readable code  
5. Analyze time and space complexity
